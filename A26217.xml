            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE AULNAGE CASE, OR</hi> REASONS Offer'd for taking away the Office of <hi>Aulnage,</hi> and changing the Subſidy of <hi>Aulnage</hi> into a <hi>Cuſtom.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THERE is a Duty payable to the Crown for almoſt all the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture now made in <hi>England,</hi> which is called the Subſidy of Aulnage, which is to be paid by the Cloathiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Duty alſo payable to the Crown for the ſame Manufacture when it is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, which is called the Subſidy of Tunnage and Poundage, and is to be paid by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe;</hi> both theſe are charged upon the Manufacture.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe is granted by Patent to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and by her let to Farm to Sir <hi>John Eyles,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The manner of Collecting which is extreamly chargeable to the Crown, and very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to the Subject, and hath along time been complained of; for every Shilling the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers pay to the Crown or Dutcheſs of <hi>Richmond,</hi> they collect above two of the Cloathiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides the charge and trouble they are put to in attending ſeveral Offices to get their Goods Sealed, which in many places is greater than the payment of the Duty.</p>
            <p>The Deſign therefore is, that this Subſidy of Aulnage might be taken away, and in lieu thereof, an Equivolent Duty might be added to the Subſidy of Tunnage and Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, to be received at the ſame time, and in the ſame manner, and by the ſame Officer, which now receives the preſent Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>And if a Duty not exceeding what was paid to the Aulnagers, upon a Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the late exactions be made payable at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſes,</hi> it will bring in more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Crown, then is now, or can be paid if the Aulnage Office ſhould be continued, as is ready to be made appear, by Accounts taken out of the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Advantages by this change will be many: For,</p>
            <p n="1">I. It will wholly take away the Grievance of Collecting, freeing the Cloathiers from the trouble of attending to get their Goods ſealed (which Seals are of no other uſe then to Signifie that the Duty if paid.)</p>
            <p n="2">II. It will raiſe a ſufficient Sum of Money to pay the Dutcheſs as much or more than ſhe now receives yearly, or can if the Aulnage Office ſhould be continued.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It will ſave the People of <hi>England</hi> three or four thouſand Pound <hi>per annum,</hi> which they now pay to maintain an Office and Officers, which are a great burden to them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It will exempt part of the Wollen Manufacture (all that is uſed in <hi>England</hi>) from the payment of any Duty, and yet a greater will not be laid upon tha which will ſtill be liable to pay;</p>
            <p n="5">V. It will free all the Merchants, Retailers, and others from the damage and trouble of having their Shops and Ware-houſes ſearch'd, their Goods riffel'd, their Pieces and Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants carried away for want of Seals, which oft times drop off, and cannot be prevented, and from the payment of unreaſonable Sums to have them again.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It will diſcharge all thoſe that are under yearly Contribution (to be free from ſearch) from the payment of any more Rent, (of which there is no near two hundred in one County.)</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It will put an end to a great many vexatious and chargeable Law-ſuits, which are now depending about the right of the ſaid Duty, and prevent a great many that are like to ariſe: (In ſhort) it will be no ways prejudicial to the Revenue of the Crown, nor to the Intereſt of the Dutcheſs, nor create any new or greater trouble upon the Merchant, or charge upon the Merchandize, but will be of great advantage to all the Cloathiers, and all other Woollen Manufacturers in <hi>England.</hi> All which is ready more fully to be demonſtrated.</p>
